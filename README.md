### Transact
An open-source robot fleet management dashboard

by Transitive Robotics

-----

Transact is an example of the kinds of robot fleet management dashboards/cloud portals/mission control centers/robot operating centers you can build using Transitive. It serves three purposes:
1. demonstrate how Transitive, the open-source framework, can be used to build web-based robot management systems,
1. demonstrate how to integrate [Transitive Capabilities](https://transitiverobotics.com/caps/) into your own web dashboards, and
1. serving as a reference implementation that we invite you to fork and build on if you are just starting out building your own system.

We believe that robotics companies face a [make-vs-buy dilemma](https://transitiverobotics.com/blog/make-vs-buy/) and our mission is to solve this by offering a middle-ground: making it easy for them to build their own fleet management system that perfectly meets their needs.
